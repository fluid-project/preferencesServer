# Data Model

This documentation describes the current data model used by the Personal Data
Service.  It is based on the data model used in the [GPII project](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Main_Page).
GPII's data model was implemented using CouchDB but the Personal Data Service
will use PostgresSQL.

Diagrams below are drawn using [Entity Relationship Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model).
Arrows are used to express cardinality where a single line indicates
"one single", and the crow's foot indicates "one or more". For example, a single
`Prefs Safe` could have one or more `PrefsSafe Keys`, or in other words, one
or more keys can reference to the same preferences safe.

## The Data Model

This data model was in development when the GPII project ended. The goal was to
support the user management feature implemented using [fluid-express-user](https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-express-user).

## Table Descriptions

### Prefs Safes

- QUESTIONS:
  - Is the `password` field needed, or is the one in the associated `User` record
    sufficient (`User.derived_key`)?  Is the `password` field "optional", and used
   only for the `PrefsSafesKey` access?
  - Similarly, are the `name` and `email` needed?  They are also built into
    `User`s.  Again, only needed for `PrefsSafesKey` access?

| Name             | Type                        | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---              | ---                         | ---       |  ---    | ---         |
| prefsSafesId     | String                      | Required  | None    | Unique ID of this preferences safe. |
| safeType         | enum of ["snapset", "user"] | Required  | "user"  | Indicates whether this preferences safe is allowed to be modified: the ones with "snapset" type are unmodifiable while the ones with "user" type are modifiable. |
| name             | String                      | Optional  | null    | The user defined name for the corresponding preferences safe. A pair of “preference-safe-name and password” can potentially be used as a key. |
| password         | String                      | Optional  | null    | The user defined password for this preferences safe. A “preference-safe-name and password” pair can potentially be used as a key. In the future data model, this field is moved to the "Users" document that holds login information for the user management. |
| email            | String                      | Optional  | null    | The user email. |
| preferences      | Object                      | Required  | null    | The user preferences. Refer to the "More Document Field Examples and Explanations" section for an example of this field. |
| timestampCreated | Date                        | Required  | now()   | The timestamp when the token is created. |
| timestampUpdated | Date                        | Optional  | null    | The timestamp when the token is updated. |

### Users

Table of Records that contains information about users.

## Field Examples and Explanations

### prefsSafes.preferences

Object. Required.

- Each preferences set in a preferences safe is keyed by an internally generated
  id. The default preferences set is keyed by a fixed string "default".
- Each preferences set contains a field called "name" that is to save the user
  defined name for this preferences set.

Example:

``` .json
{
    "prefsSets": {
        "default": {
            "name": "Default preferences",   // user defined name
            "preferences": {
                "http://registry.gpii.net/common/highContrastEnabled": true,
                "http://registry.gpii.net/common/highContrastTheme": "white-black",

                    "value": 1024
                },
                {

                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### clientCredentials

This table contains all OAuth2 client credentials assigned to all OAuth clients, including: 1. App installation clients;
2. Privileged prefs creator clients; 3. Web prefs consumer clients.

- At any time, each client should only have one active un-revoked client
  credential in this document.
- TODO: there's an ongoing discussion on whether to stop support privileged
  prefs creator clients and web prefs consumer clients.

``` .json
{
    "id": "clientCredential-1",
    "clientId": "appInstallationClient-1",
    "oauth2ClientId": "<random string of characters>",
    "oauth2ClientSecret": "<random string of characters>",
    "revoked": false,
    "revokedReason": null,
    "timestampCreated": "2017-11-21T18:11:22.101Z",
    "timestampRevoked": null
}
```

## TODO list

- Update the diagram to match the tabular descriptions.
